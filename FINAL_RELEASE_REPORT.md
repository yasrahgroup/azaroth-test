- ❌ **Production infrastructure not verified** (database, email, secrets)

### Release Conditions

The application may proceed to production deployment ONLY if:

1. **Security vulnerabilities are addressed:**
   - Upgrade nodemailer to 10.1.0 with code review and testing
   - Upgrade react-router-dom to 7.18.4 with code review and testing
   - Implement rate limiting on all form submission endpoints

2. **Production infrastructure is verified:**
   - Database connection tested with production credentials
   - Email delivery tested with production SMTP credentials
   - Environment variables properly configured and secured
   - Upload directory permissions verified

3. **Performance optimizations completed:**
   - Large image assets optimized (WebP format, compression)
   - Image lazy loading implemented
   - Bundle size reviewed and optimized if needed

4. **E2E tests updated:**
   - Playwright selectors updated to match current UI
   - All 6 E2E tests passing

5. **Accessibility audit completed:**
   - axe-core or Lighthouse accessibility audit run
   - Critical accessibility issues resolved

### Post-Release Actions
